You are assisting in a Three.js based web project. The 3D model is displayed using WebGL and OrbitControls. I need you to generate code that displays a small animated "Drag to Rotate" hint overlay when the model first loads.

Requirements:
1. The hint should be a simple overlay placed above the canvas, centered at the bottom.
2. Use a minimal SVG or CSS-based animation (do not require external files like GIFs).
3. The hint must disappear after the user interacts with the model (either mouse drag or touch drag).
4. Support both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch).
5. Include:
   - HTML structure
   - CSS styling (with fade-out transition)
   - JavaScript logic to hide animation after first interaction
6. The code must work with: Three.js + OrbitControls.
7. Final output must be standalone, clearly separated into HTML, CSS, and JS.

Generate final output now.
